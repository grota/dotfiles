# Voxtype Configuration

# Location: ~/.config/voxtype/config.toml
# All settings can be overridden via CLI flags

# State file for external integrations (Waybar, polybar, etc.)
# Use "auto" for default location ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/voxtype/state),
# a custom path, or "disabled" to turn off. The daemon writes state
# ("idle", "recording", "transcribing") to this file whenever it changes.
# Required for `voxtype record toggle` and `voxtype status` commands.
state_file = "auto"

[hotkey]

# Common choices: SCROLLLOCK, PAUSE, RIGHTALT, F13-F24
# Use `evtest` to find key names for your keyboard

# Optional modifier keys that must also be held
# Example: modifiers = ["LEFTCTRL", "LEFTALT"]
modifiers = ["RIGHTCTRL"]

# Activation mode: "push_to_talk" or "toggle"
# - push_to_talk: Hold hotkey to record, release to transcribe (default)
# - toggle: Press hotkey once to start recording, press again to stop
mode = "push_to_talk"

# Enable built-in hotkey detection (default: true)
# Set to false when using compositor keybindings (Hyprland, Sway) instead
# When disabled, use `voxtype record start/stop/toggle` to control recording
# enabled = true

[audio]

# List devices with: pactl list sources short

# Sample rate in Hz (whisper expects 16000)

[whisper]

# - local: Use whisper.cpp locally (default)
# - remote: Send audio to a remote whisper.cpp server or OpenAI-compatible API
# backend = "local"

# Model to use for transcription (local backend)
# Options: tiny, tiny.en, base, base.en, small, small.en, medium, medium.en, large-v3, large-v3-turbo
# .en models are English-only but faster and more accurate for English
# large-v3-turbo is faster than large-v3 with minimal accuracy loss (recommended for GPU)
# Or provide absolute path to a custom .bin model file

# --- Remote backend settings (used when backend = "remote") ---

#   - OpenAI API: "https://api.openai.com"
# remote_endpoint = "http://192.168.1.100:8080"

# Fall back to clipboard if typing fails
# fallback_to_clipboard = true

# Delay between typed characters in milliseconds
# 0 = fastest possible, increase if characters are dropped

# Automatically submit (send Enter key) after outputting transcribed text
# Useful for chat applications, command lines, or forms where you want
# to auto-submit after dictation
# auto_submit = true

# Pre/post output hooks (optional)
# Commands to run before and after typing output. Useful for compositor integration.
# Example: Block modifier keys during typing with Hyprland submap:
#   pre_output_command = "hyprctl dispatch submap voxtype_suppress"
#   post_output_command = "hyprctl dispatch submap reset"
# See troubleshooting docs for the required Hyprland submap configuration.

# Post-processing command (optional)
# Pipe transcribed text through an external command for cleanup before output.
# The command receives text on stdin and outputs processed text on stdout.
# Useful for LLM-based text cleanup, grammar correction, filler word removal.
# On any failure (timeout, error), falls back to original transcription.
#
# [output.post_process]
# command = "ollama run llama3.2:1b 'Clean up this dictation. Fix grammar, remove filler words. Output only the cleaned text:'"
# timeout_ms = 30000  # 30 second timeout (generous for LLM)

# [status]

#     - "emoji"     - Default emoji icons (🎙️ 🎤 ⏳)

#     - "codicons"  - VS Code icons (requires Codicons font)
#     - "omarchy"   - Omarchy distro icons
#   Universal (no special fonts needed):
#     - "minimal"   - Simple Unicode (○ ● ◐ ×)
#     - "dots"      - Geometric shapes (◯ ⬤ ◔ ◌)
#     - "arrows"    - Media player style (▶ ● ↻ ■)
#     - "text"      - Plain text ([MIC] [REC] [...] [OFF])
